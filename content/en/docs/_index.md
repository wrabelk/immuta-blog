![Diátaxis Diagram](/diataxis-diagram.png 'Diátaxis Diagram')

It’s my team’s responsibility to serve all readers, including the knowledgeable ones, including the anxious ones, including the angry ones.

This is challenging — I’m sure you’ve experienced this when writing blogs, which we talked about last time, when it goes out to everyone. Or, more recently, coming up with bullets for the WSR.

So I want to shed some light on a framework.

This framework 
Supports our readers’ needs and allows them to move nonlinearly as they need to and as their understanding changes.
This also highlights where there are gaps in our docs, where we could do better.

To make this process easier on my writers (and you should consider one, too), we’ve adopted a framework for our docs (this is strictly for technical documentation that explains something technical, but there are other frameworks and methodologies out there) called Diátaxis.

Diátaxis seeks to structure technical documentation, to serve users’ needs and goals as they relate to a product (our audiences are complex, their problems are complex and varying, and so how we write about the same feature (which can be used by different personas) needs to be written differently).

Essentially, these needs can be met by approaching the documentation of a feature/software with 4 buckets/genres of a document:

Technical Reference
Explanation
Tutorials
How-To Guides

These four types should be kept separate, as they serve different purposes and so must have different formats, styles, and content.

This structure helps orient our readers in our docs, but it also helps our writers. Instead of agonizing over where something should go, we can more simply determine where it should go by asking ourselves questions 
Is this to serve our study/understanding or to serve our work?
Is this meant to be practical in application? Or is it theoretical knowledge?

What do you want for breakfast?

Poptarts
Banana bread

Who are you
I have to make something
I want to understand what I’m consuming
I want to understand context, why?
I need to learn how to cook…


I have to make something — recipes (how-to guides)
I want to understand what I’m consuming — reference guide/article
I want to understand context —- explanatory article
I need to learn how to cook — tutorial


Much like when I was a kid reading choose your own adventure novels, what I wanted changed as the story unfolded. Sometimes I would go back and change the path — unlike in other novels where reading was linear — this wasn’t — it was recursive
