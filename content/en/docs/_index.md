It’s my team’s responsibility to serve all readers, including the knowledgeable ones, including the anxious ones, including the angry ones.

This is challenging — I’m sure you’ve experienced this when writing blogs or whitpapers, when responding to customers' support tickets and emails, or even when communicating internally across the company.

I want to shed some light on the Diátaxis Documentation Framework, an approach for structuring technical documentation.

Diátaxis seeks to structure technical documentation, to serve users’ needs and goals as they relate to a product (our audiences are complex, their problems are complex and varying, and so how we write about the same feature (which can be used by different personas) needs to be written differently).

Essentially, these needs can be met by approaching the documentation of software with 4 buckets/genres of a document:

* How-To Guides
* Reference Guides
* Explanatory Guides
* Tutorials

These four types should be kept separate, as they serve different purposes and so must have different formats, styles, and content.

As you can see in the image above, readers' needs fall on two axes: what they need to do with the knowledge (serve their work or their study -- theory/practice and application/acquisition): "Documentation therefore either contains theoretical knowledge or describes practical actions, and is concerned either with serving our acquisition or our application of knowledge." 

This framework supports our readers’ needs and allows them to move nonlinearly as their needs  and understanding change. Much like when I was a kid reading choose your own adventure novels, what I wanted changed as the story unfolded. Sometimes I would go back and change the path — unlike in other novels where reading was linear — this wasn’t — it was recursive 

This structure also highlights gaps in our docs, where we can do better.

This structure helps orient our readers in our docs, but it also helps our writers. Instead of agonizing over where something should go, we can more simply determine where it should go by asking ourselves questions a few questions before we begin writing. I've illustrated this thought process in the diagram below:

Largley, as writers we need to identify

1. who the audience is,
1. how the document should serve them (their learning or their business goals), and
1. whether the document is for practical application or theoretical knowledge.

"These 4 modes correspond to how people become experts in a craft:

* learning-oriented phase: We begin by learning, and learning a skill means diving straight in to do it - under the guidance of a teacher.

* task-oriented phase: Next we want to put the skill to work.

* information-oriented phase: As soon as our work calls upon knowledge that we don’t already have, it requires us to consult technical reference.

* explanation-oriented phase: Finally, away from the work, we reflect on our practice and knowledge to understand the whole."

The Splunk documentation team actually uses learning objectives to write their docs, even though the learning objective itself published in the final copy.
