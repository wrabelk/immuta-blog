It’s my team’s responsibility to serve all readers -- the knowledgeable ones, the inexperienced ones, and the angry ones.

Needless to say, reaching each of them is challenging. I’m sure you’ve experienced the same thing when writing blogs or whitpapers, when responding to customers' support tickets and emails, or even when communicating internally across the company.

Before you can begin writing, you have to understand what your audience needs. Once you identify those needs, you have to contend with how to structure the content when these needs differ (as they invariably will) from person to person.

For our documentation team, the Diataxis Documentation Framework can ease some of this struggle and serve the needs of each of our readers.

## What is Diátaxis?

Diátaxis structures technical documentation around users’ needs and goals as they relate to a product. Our audience is diverse, their problems are complex and varying, and so how we write about a single concept needs to be written differently based on who those readers are, what their purpose is, and where they are in their phase of understanding our product.

At its heart, Diátaxis reflects four phases of learning (or how people become experts in a craft) to overcome some of these challenges:

* learning-oriented phase: We begin by learning. We learn a skill by *doing*, under the guidance of a teacher.

* task-oriented phase: Next we want to put the skill to work.

* information-oriented phase: As soon as our work calls upon knowledge that we don’t already have, it requires us to consult technical reference.

* explanation-oriented phase: Finally, away from the work, we reflect on our practice and knowledge to understand the whole.

From those four phases of learning, Diátaxis creates a map that divides documentation into four modes that correspond to each of the four phases of expertise above, each of which should be distinct from the others:

* Tutorials (learning-oriented)
* How-To Guides (task-oriented)
* Reference Guides (information-oriented)
* Explanatory Guides (explanation-oriented)

The diagram above illustrates that documentation

* describes specific actions the reader should take or contains theoretical knowledge (Practical Steps vs Article)
* is either serves readers' application or acquisition of knowledge (Enhances Work vs Enhances Learning)

Learning is messy and recursive. Much like when I was a kid reading choose your own adventure novels (if you're too young to remember those, maybe you remember the *Black Mirror: Bandersnatch* hype from a few years ago), what I wanted from the story changed as it unfolded. This framework brings structure to chaos and supports our readers’ needs and allows them to move nonlinearly as their needs  and understanding change. 

## Helping Writers

This structure helps orient our readers in our docs, but it also helps our writers. Instead of agonizing over where something should go, we incoporate this framework into our processes by asking ourselves a few questions before we begin writing. I've illustrated this thought process in the diagram below:

Largley, as writers we need to identify

1. who the audience is
1. whether the document should serve their learning or their business goals
1. whether the document is for practical application or theoretical knowledge

If we clearly answer those questions, the document begins to take shape before we've even begun writing.
