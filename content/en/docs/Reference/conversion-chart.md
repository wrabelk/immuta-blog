The [America's Test Kitchen Conversion Chart](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/cooksillustrated/how_tos/5490-baking-conversion-chart) below documents how to convert ounces to grams.

## Flour

* 1 cup all-purpose flour = 5 oz / 142g
* 1 cup cake flour = 4 oz / 113g
* 1 cup whole wheat flour = 5½ oz / 156g
* 1 cup granulated (white) sugar = 7 oz / 198g
* 1 cup packed brown sugar (light or dark) = 7 oz / 198g
* 1 cup confectioners' sugar = 4 oz / 113g
* 1 cup cocoa powder = 3 oz / 85g

## Butter

* 4 tablespoons (½ stick, or ¼ cup) = 2 oz / 57g
* 8 tablespoons (1 stick, or ½ cup) = 4 oz / 113g
* 16 tablespoons (2 sticks, or 1 cup) = 8 oz / 227g

## Notes

U.S. all-purpose flour does not contain leaveners, as some European flours do. These leavened flours are called self-rising or self-raising. If you are using self-rising flour, take this into consideration before adding leavening to a recipe.

In the United States, butter is sold both salted and unsalted. We generally recommend unsalted butter. If you are using salted butter, take this into consideration before adding salt to a recipe.
