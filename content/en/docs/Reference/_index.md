Reference guides are technical descriptions of a product and are information-oriented. Like How-to guides, they empower readers to get their work done.

The only thing a reference guide should do is describe in detail (concisely) in an organized way. It shouldn’t tell the reader how to do something or why. It just describes and defines the software or subject itself, including its behavior and the correct way to use it, but they don’t show readers how to perform tasks.

These guides provide readers with certainty. 

To extend my poptart analogy, the reference material could be a conversion guide, definitions of mincing vs dicing, sifting vs scooping,definitions of equipment needed.
