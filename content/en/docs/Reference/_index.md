Reference guides are technical descriptions of a product. Like how-to guides, they empower readers to get their work done, and, like explanatory guides, they are information-oriented. Instead of being written as step-by-step instructions, they're written as articles.

A reference guide only describes its subject in detail (concisely). It doesn't tell the reader how to do something or why they should do something. It describes and defines the subject itself, but doesn't show readers how to perform tasks.

Because they are structured around the subject they describe and are not learning-oriented, these guides are not read as a series of steps. Instead, they are *consulted*, providing readers with certainty and clarity.

## General Example: Food

The reference material for poptarts (or any food) would be something I consult to clarify something as I'm following the recipe, such as a weight conversion guide, definition of sifting scooping, or descriptions of equipment used to make the poptarts.

These reference guides would

* clarify questions I have about work I'm trying to complete.
* be concise and structured in a way that I could quickly consult them and then continue my work.

### Immuta Documentation Examples

In our documentation, a reference guide would be something like

* API reference guide.
* architecutre diagrams and integration descriptions.

Like the food example, these guides enhance our readers' work, and they are information-oriented.
