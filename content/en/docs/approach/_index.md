It’s tempting to overhaul all the documentation at once to fit the framework because it’s compelling, because it will more readily meet readers’ needs and highlight which of the four genres/modes is missing in our documentation. But that approach won’t be successful: it would take too long, and our product would change by the time we were ready to release the docs.

Instead, we will be taking an iterative approach to writing these docs (as is suggested by the creator/designer of the Diátaxis framework). Rather than changing everything all at once, we will be looking to specific sections, specific pages to ask ourselves
What mode is this? Does it belong here?
What could we change on this specific page to apply this framework?

This will help us determine whether or not we’re going in the right direction as we move forward. And, if we’re not, we can simply pivot and make changes that get us moving in the right direction again.

Why does this matter to you?

Writing is imperative for all teams, so I wanted to share an approach to writing my team has adopted to make some of our decisions easier, to more effectively serve our readers’ needs no matter their persona or experience.

Perhaps you can consider frameworks for your own team or for yourself. Maybe you just have a better understanding of what technical writers do here, and this understanding will impact how you experience working with our team.

I shared all of this content with you to make my team's thinking and processes more visible to everyone here. Not all of the plans described are perfect, nor are they all-encompassing. Instead, this is the first act in our plan to build rapport with our readers, our stakeholders, who can provide guidance, wisdom, and feedback by sharing their own perspectives and challenges.

This is the beginning of a conversation, connection, a celebration of what we have done and a celebration of those who helped in significant ways. This is an effort to translate our vision into something meaningful to you, not because it’s perfect, but because
