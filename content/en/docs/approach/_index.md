Writing is imperative for all teams, so I wanted to share an approach to writing my team is considering to make some of our decisions easier, to more effectively serve our readersâ€™ needs no matter their persona or experience.

Even if you're not writing technical documentation consistently, maybe you'll consider frameworks for your team or for yourself. 

Maybe you'll just have a better understanding of what technical writers do here, and this understanding will impact how you experience working with our team.

No matter what, I shared all of this content with you to make my team's thinking and processes more visible to everyone. None of the plans described are perfectly implemented yet, nor are they all-encompassing. Instead, this is the first act in our plan to build rapport with our readers and our stakeholders, who can provide guidance, wisdom, and feedback by sharing their perspectives and challenges.

This is the beginning of a conversation, a connection. This is an effort to translate our vision into something meaningful.
