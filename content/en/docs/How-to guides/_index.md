How-to guides are easily confused with tutorials. I’ve conflated them for a few years now without realizing it. Both how-to guides and tutorials include practical steps that lead the reader through to a specific end. 

The difference between a how-to guide and a tutorial is that how-to guides are focused on solving a specific business problem or achieving a goal. They are reader-centered, but they are not learning-centered: readers don't consume how-to guides because they want to acquire knowledge or a skill; they want to get something done.

## General Example: A Recipe

If I want to make homemade poptarts to share with the office, the recipe is the how-to guide:

* it helps me achieve a specific goal: to make poptarts.
* it expects that I have a certain level of competence -- that I know how to soften butter, that I can roll out dough, and that I know how to use a food processor. It’s not concerned with teaching me skills to improve my baking ability.
* it's written in a series of practical steps. I actually *apply* the content; I don't just gain knowledge.

### Immuta Documentation Examples

In our documentation, a how-to guide could lead readers through something like

* connecting their external IAM to Immuta.
* writing a Global Subscription Policy that meets a customer's compliance requirement.
* configuring the Databricks integration.

Like the recipe example, these guides help our readers achieve business goals, expect a certain level of competence, and are  written in a series of steps they apply.
