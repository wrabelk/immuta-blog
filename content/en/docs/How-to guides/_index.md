How-to guides are easily confused with tutorials (I’ve conflated and confused them for a few years now): both contain steps that lead the reader through to a specific end. 

The difference between a how-to guide and a tutorial, though, is that how-to guides are focused on solving a specific business problem or achieving a business goal. How-to guides focus on the work a reader needs to complete and expect a basic level of competence. If you don’t have that, you need to consult a tutorial before proceeding).

For example, I want to make homemade poptarts to share with the Columbus office. The recipe is a how-to guide. It expects that I know how to soften butter, that I can roll out dough, and that I know how to use a food processor. It’s not concerned about teaching me basic skills. It’s concerned with guiding me through to achieve my goal or task: to make poptarts.
