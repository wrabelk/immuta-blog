I didn't feel comfortable publishing the recipe here, as it was originally published in Stella Parks' *[BraveTart: Iconic American Desserts](http://bravetart.com/)*. 

However, that recipe (which I used to make the poptarts in the picture above) was [reprinted with permission online in 2021](https://www.thekitchn.com/stella-parks-homemade-pop-tarts-23265682).

Now that you've seen the how-to guide for making poptarts, maybe you realize you need to understand how to properly knead dough.

Maybe you're curious about the history of Kellogg's PopTarts.

Or, potentially, maybe you want to know how to make tater tot casserole instead.

Each of these needs is met by a different mode of writing in the Diátaxis framework. Navigate to one of these sections to learn more.
