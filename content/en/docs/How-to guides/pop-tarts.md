I didn't feel comfortable publishing the recipe on this page, as it was originally published in Stella Parks' *[BraveTart: Iconic American Desserts](http://bravetart.com/)*. 

However, that recipe, which I used to make the poptarts pictured above, was [reprinted with permission online in 2021](https://www.thekitchn.com/stella-parks-homemade-pop-tarts-23265682).
