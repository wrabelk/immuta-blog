![Explanatory Diagram](/explanatory.png 'Explanatory Diagram')

Explanatory guides broaden readersâ€™ understanding of a topic, which makes them learning-oriented. Theses guides empower readers to acquire knowledge, not apply it through a series of pratical steps.

Instead, these guides are conversational. They explore other possibilities, explain context, and consider the subject from different angles. Unlike the other modes of documentation, expanatory guides don't directly impact a readers' work or practice. Instead of helping readers learn how to *do* a craft, they help them *understand* the craft.

## General Example: Historical and Cultural Context

To extend the poptarts analaogy, an example of an explanatory guide about poptarts could discuss the history of poptarts in America, how they differ in other countries, or how they have changed over time and why.

This explanatory guide

* isn't concerned with what I'm doing as a reader or what goals I want to achieve. 
* broadens my understanding of poptarts.
* isn't written in a series of practical steps. I'm not applying my understanding; I'm just acquring knowledge.

### Immuta Documentation Examples

In our documentation, an explanatory guide could discuss something like

* a discussion of RBAC and ABAC
* how two versions of an integration compare and why a specific design was chosen. 

Like the poptarts example, these guides don't directly help our readers achieve business goals. Instead, they broaden their understanding.
