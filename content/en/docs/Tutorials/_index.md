Tutorial is a term that we use pretty loosely currently in our docs. Our tutorials have step-by-step instructions for using a feature, but this approach isn’t actually a tutorial, according to the Diátaxis framework. 

A tutorial is a lesson. It leads the reader through a series of steps to acquire a specific skill, so it is learning-oriented -- unlike how-to guides, which are business- or work-oriented. The purpose of a tutorial is to build readers’ competence and confidence with the product. If a tutorial is written well, readers should be able to take the skills they honed and apply them to their own challenges and use cases.

## General Example: A Recipe

If I want to make homemade poptarts to share with the office, but I've never actually baked anything before or learned how to use a food processor, jumping into the recipe would be a disaster. Before I can make poptarts, there are basic skills I need to have with pastry before I can begin.

For example, a tutorial that explains how to properly roll out dough would
* provide step-by-step instructions that get me using the tools I need.
* allow me to acquire a basic skill
* build the confidence I need (after I've achieved) to follow the poptarts recipe (the how-to guide)

### Immuta Documentation Examples

In our documentation, a tutorial could lead readers through something like

* using the policy builder.
* writing an effective ABAC policy.

Like the recipe example, these tutorials help our readers acquire skills; they are learning-oriented.
