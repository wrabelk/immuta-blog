Tutorial is a term that we use pretty loosely currently in our docs. In our documentation, our tutorials have step-by-step instructions for using a feature.

This approach isn’t actually a tutorial, though, not the way we use them. A tutorial should lead the reader through to learn a specific skill. Unlike how-to guides, it is learning-oriented, not business- or work-oriented. The purpose of a tutorial is to build readers’ competence with the product — we should teach for transfer, so they can then take those skills they learned and apply them to their own challenges and use cases.

For example, before I can make home-made poptarts, there are basic competencies I need to have with pastry before I can begin.

What does the recipe actually mean when it says to soften butter?
How do I roll out dough?
How do I use a food processor?

Splunk documentation actually uses learning objectives when they write their docs.
